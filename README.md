# twitter_demos

Welcome!

Contained in this repository are the notebooks/scripts for some of the X (formerly Twitter) threads from my profile (see [here](https://twitter.com/DrDanobi)).

**Please note that these codes are for education and entertainment only** - the code included on the threads have the sole purpose of demonstrating thoughts and ideas of how you can use Python and Machine Learning in your work. How I personally use such ideas may be different. The full disclaimer can be found below!

My intention for this repo is to have an easy place for people to get the code I post. 

Since I have a lot on my plate (9-5, trading, gym, posting, developing new ideas/strategies...), and given this is all demo code, I doubt I will a lot of time/energy to maintain this code properly.

Remember, copy-paste is everyone's best friend, until it's their worst enemy, so don't take everything here as gold standard ðŸ™‚

## How I Will Update this Repo

This repository will be a work-in-progress sort of deal whilst I figure out the kinks over time. I may change the file structure around a little, if I feel something is more suitable. **Therefore, I'd suggest bookmarking the repository, rather than a particular link to a notebook/script**

If I post any new code on X, then I will update this repo accordingly with the new file.

## Contact

You can get in contact with me on [X](https://twitter.com/DrDanobi) - I'm typically quite reponsive over DMs. If I miss one, I'll try and get to it eventually but don't be scared to give me a nudge. Shorter questions will likely yield a quicker reply!
